    <article class="article-content">
        <div class="container">
            <p>Last year I worked at TeamG Academy in Southern California — a high-performance tennis academy that trains nationally ranked junior players. It was one of the most formative experiences of my career, not because of what I learned about tennis, but because of what I learned about running operations in a client-focused environment.</p>
            
            <p>Here are the three biggest lessons I took away.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Player Development Doesn't End When They Leave the Court</h2>
            
            <p>At a high-performance academy, the players who develop fastest aren't necessarily the most talented. They're the ones whose entire support system is aligned around their growth.</p>
            
            <p>I learned quickly that my job wasn't just to coach players during their sessions. It was to manage a whole ecosystem of relationships:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parents</strong> — who are investing time, money, and emotional energy into their child's development</li>
                <li><strong>Other coaches</strong> — who see the player in different contexts and have insights I might miss</li>
                <li><strong>The players themselves</strong> — who need to understand not just what to do, but why</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The real work happened between sessions: sending post-training notes with specific things to work on, sharing fitness plans for off-court conditioning, coordinating with other coaches on player progress, and keeping families informed and engaged.</p>
            
            <blockquote>The best player development is 360-degree development. It requires constant communication and coordination — not just instruction.</blockquote>
            
            <p>This taught me something fundamental about any client-facing role: the "service" isn't just the core deliverable. It's everything around it. The proactive communication, the follow-up, the coordination with stakeholders. That's where real value gets created.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Identifying Who's Ready to Level Up</h2>
            
            <p>One of the most important operational skills I developed was recognizing which players were ready to move from group sessions to private coaching.</p>
            
            <p>It's not just about talent. It's about spotting the combination of aptitude, desire, and readiness to commit. Some players have the skills but not the drive. Others have incredible work ethic but aren't quite ready technically. The art is finding players where all three align — and then making the case to their families.</p>
            
            <p>This matters for the club too. Private sessions are higher-touch and higher-value. Moving the right players at the right time maximizes engagement for the player <em>and</em> revenue for the academy. It's a win-win — but only if you read the situation correctly.</p>
            
            <h3>What I looked for:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Players who stayed after group sessions to work on things themselves</li>
                <li>Players who asked specific questions about technique, not just "how'd I do?"</li>
                <li>Parents who were engaged but not overbearing — supportive without being pushy</li>
                <li>A track record of showing up consistently, even when it was hard</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This is a transferable skill. In any business, identifying which clients are ready for a deeper engagement — and which aren't — is critical. Push too soon and you lose trust. Wait too long and you miss the moment.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Building Programs for High-Level Players</h2>
            
            <p>Generic programs don't work for serious athletes. At TeamG, I learned how to develop customized training plans that addressed each player's specific strengths, weaknesses, and goals.</p>
            
            <p>This meant:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Assessment</strong> — Understanding where a player actually is, not where they think they are</li>
                <li><strong>Goal-setting</strong> — Working with the player and their family to define clear, achievable milestones</li>
                <li><strong>Program design</strong> — Building a training plan that addresses weaknesses while leveraging strengths</li>
                <li><strong>Iteration</strong> — Constantly adjusting based on progress, feedback, and changing circumstances</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The best programs weren't static documents. They were living plans that evolved as the player evolved. That required staying close to the player, tracking progress carefully, and being willing to change course when something wasn't working.</p>
            
            <blockquote>Customization isn't a luxury — it's a requirement for anyone serious about development.</blockquote>
            
            <h2>The Bigger Lesson</h2>
            
            <p>Working at TeamG taught me that operations in a client-focused business isn't about systems and processes for their own sake. It's about creating the conditions for people to succeed.</p>
            
            <p>That means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communicating proactively, not just reactively</li>
                <li>Managing relationships across the entire stakeholder ecosystem</li>
                <li>Identifying opportunities to deepen engagement at the right moments</li>
                <li>Customizing your approach to meet people where they are</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These are the skills I'm most excited to bring to whatever comes next. The context might be different, but the fundamentals transfer everywhere.</p>
